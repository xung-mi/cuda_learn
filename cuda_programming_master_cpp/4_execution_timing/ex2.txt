Submit the main function and kernel for the implementation. Also you have to submit the execution time of your implementation as well.

Questions for this assignment
1. Imagine you have 3 randomly initialized arrays with 2 to the power 22 elements (4194304). You have to write a CUDA program to sum up these three arrays in your device.  

2. First write the c function to sum up these 3 arrays in CPU.

3. Then write kernel and launch that kernel to sum up these three arrays in GPU.

4. You have to use the CPU timer we discussed in the first section to measure the timing of your CPU and GPU implementations.

5. You have to add CUDA error checking mechanism we discussed as well.

6. Your grid should be 1Dimensional.

7. Use 64, 128, 256, 512 as block size in X dimension and run your GPU implementations with each of these block configurations and measure the execution time.
